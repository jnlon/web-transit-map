# Web Transit Map

Web Transit Map is a web-based frontend to [gtfs-rest](https://www.github.com/jnlon/gtfs-rest) utilizing [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and map data from [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org).

Web Transit Map queries a gtfs-rest server for stop, route, and schedule data and makes it accessible over an interactive slippy map, similiar to Google Maps if your city publishes transit data in the [GTFS format](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/).

## Motivation

The goal is to create an open-source, self-hostable web application for viewing and discovering transit data in your area. Please see [gtfs-rest](https://www.github.com/jnlon/gtfs-rest) for more information.
